content: 'Going in without any research: - Check the ‘About Us’ link on the company website and read their mission statement- memories their values and find opportunities to mention this in the interviews. Use Google to see when they are mentioned or if they make any company announcement to give you a better understanding of the type of business they are.

Poor body language: - Feeling disinterested will result in you also looking disinterested. Think about how you come across if your arms are across, waiting or during the interview. Eye contact, good posture, cheerful demeanor and firm handshake will get you a long way in an interview.

Fidgeting with your mobile phone and other distraction: - Our mobile phones have pretty much become an extension of us- not just for phone calls and text anymore, so it can be difficult to put away. Once you have arrived at your interview location and lock your phone


Dressing inappropriately: - Casual might be becoming more of trend, professional attire is still considered the most appropriate etiquettes for interviews. It’s all about first impression.

Turning up late:- Unless you have an emergency or very good reason for running late and have called ahead to notify or reschedule, turning up late for a job interview will not sit well an employer, hiring  manager or recruiter.

Unclear answer and rambling: - Take a few seconds and think about the interview question before responding. Ensure you don’t go off on tangents or end abruptly without rounding out your answer back to what was asked. Also avoid mumbling or speaking or speaking too fast.

Speaking negatively about current or past employer: - Never complain about your current or former employers. No matter how ineffectual or bad the situation was badmouthing will not reflect well on you.

Having Zero Questions to ask: - It can be about the specific of the role, something about the company you learned through research or even the current team you’ll be working with, if successful.

Lying on your CV: - Be honest from the start to the end of the interview. Anything written on your CV could be discussed at an interview so any fabrications about your work or education record will damage your chances. 

Getting a personal: - While friendliness and humour never hurts at a job interview, you need to avoid being too casual. Remember, your interviewer could become your manager so behave in a friendly and respectful manner and always keep it professional.

Sitting down before being invited or trying to run the meeting: - The hiring manager or recruiter will take the lead and direct the interviews so follow their instructions from the moment you shake their hand. Avoid slouching in your chair or putting your feet anywhere but firmly on the ground.

Discussing money or time off: - Unless an offer is put on the table or they have raised remuneration at the interview, it’s not recommended that you discuss money or request annual leave for an upcoming holiday. Because the impression you are giving is that more fixed on pay and travel than the job itself.

Swearing and using offensive language or gestures: - Thinking about what you are going to say or just taking an extra moment before you speak will slow your brain down and should help decrease the chance of an accidental swear.

No thank you or follow up: - Regardless of how you went, first and foremost, its courteous to the email the persons who interviewed you within a few hours of finishing your first interview. Not only is it good manners but it also keeps you front of mind.
